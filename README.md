Windows Console to Arduino - Control your arduino with keystrokes!

Hello Github. 
This is my first git, and my first considerably useful program. 
I feel like this can really help others, and so I want to share it. 

2016 Manash Kumar Mandal from MIT created a fantastic serial to arduino program. 
I made several changes to his c++ code found here:
https://github.com/manashmandal/SerialPort

My code implements a few features:
-Specify port (Port can be found in arduino IDE under TOOLS->PORT
    -Enter in ALL CAPS
-Arduino 328 and 2560 Support.
  - Right now this is all that is supported that I have tested. Many more may work. but that is all I have tested out.
  
  I have left some notes in the arduino. You will quickly see that by modifying your arduino code, you can activate your arduino over the web, from your computer in your house, perhaps in your barn, or at your friends house. Just implement some networking, actuators, motors, the sky is the limit.
